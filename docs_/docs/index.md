# BlanketOps Environments

![Image title](images/Screenshot.png)


## Overview üè†

- Blanketizing managed cloud resources to procure application environments of your choice.

- Build, deploy, scale, package and release from the same manifest, manage environment resources in isolation.

- Abstraction where it matters, built with GitOps and DevSecOps principles, add your customized touch.

- Procure and deploy to a set of microservices containers, depencies, pipelines, and services.

- Developement, QA and Production Environments for an application of your choice.

- CD/CI Pipelines fully and or partially automated through rules you setup.

- Zero fault tolerant centralized and distributed secrets management.

- Need worry not about managing dockerfiles, If you do not want to ofcourse.üòÑ

- Offering Environment types from years of research, bringing closer the necessary tools to manage multiple application resources as a single unit.
  From Microservices, single stack, mobile crossplatform, native, Lmamp-Wamp.
