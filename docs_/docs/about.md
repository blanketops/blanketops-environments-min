# About

## Overview üè†

- Cloud computing opened a wide range of possibilities for organizations and accelerated growth of  startups, meanwhile developers/operations engineers including quality assurance and business analysts were improving ways to collaborate effectively to deliver for their customers.

- DevOps coming of age meant this improved collaboration between different teams or resources from different departments fast tracked delivery of software and resolving of customer issues. 

- There are thousands of cloud resources and the rise keeps increasing as more services are introduced, managing multiple cloud resources has become increasingly difficult. 

- Costs of managing software and resources in the cloud is reducing significantly due to introduction of concepts such as serverless computing, however administration overhead continues to be a challenge for many organizations with multiple parts moving at the same time to continue being flexible, agile and transformative.


## Description üíº

- Blanket Ops is an Internal Developer Platform as a Service for organizations and startups to quickly setup resources in the cloud following a DevOps Model by leveraging our kubernetes operator.

- A platform agnostic system that communicates with cloud providers you register for, to create,update,view and delete resources, as compositions or exacts of cloud services.Organizations,Container Registries, Releases, custom Environments,Pipelines, Developer Workstations,Processes and Deployments from years of research following industry best practices.

- A centralized platform pluggable with multiple cloud services, manage notifications from multiple cloud resources to easily escalate/resolve incidents and customer issues, integrated with Jira, organizations can easily manage Team Dashboards, and many more by leveraging team based Jira projects.

- Blanket Ops sets apart what your employees  per role would still equally perform with less administration by providing a template with values relevant to employees in their role(i.e, DevOps Engineer to create/update environment development for a LAMP stack based application for Teams of developers).

- Stacks and microservices blue-prints and managed as images/containers, allowing focus more on the application layer scope, BlanketOps packages your desired application stack in an environment deployed to the container instance infrastructure you wish.

- A Release manager would typically manage a list of releases for applications and or scope assigned to them, integrated with Jira, custom types for Release and Hotfix will be made available for ease of administration.

- On boarding a developer to any team in a day that they speedily focus on the development tasks at hand.

## Specification üî¨

- A Kubernetes custom resource controller/operator working on your behalf to take care of building you a stack of coupled resources defined using everyday language,(i.e backend,frontend,database, and web server) creates a LAMP stack.

- Containers are run from Images you provide, stored into a registry/ies of your choice, following a serveless approach for cost effectiveness and less administrative head of managed servers/instances.

- Full scaled CD/CI Pipeline template to allow following a traditional based approach and a native container based approach to build, test, deploy, inspect and artifact your applications.

- DevSecOps pipeline templates to achieve a safe approach for application 

- Leverage deployments to container/applications by using scheduled processes, to update an image resolving a security vulnerability, maintenance and blue-green deployment for uninterrupted customer service.

## Building Blocks üìö

### Applications üèÄ
- Register your existing applications from any of the available source code repositories, view and also remove these applications.  Registering applications allows Blanket Ops access to create other resources on your behalf and keep track of the administration. Define your application stack, your mobile application type, your 3 tier resources, programming language, microservice

### Container Management/Registries üîß
- Blanket Ops is image and container based, your workloads/applications will be containers making up an environment that you define, following a LAMP stack structure (initial release), Development, Staging, Production and other related environments can easily be procured from the same template.

### Cloud Providers ‚òÅÔ∏è
- Create an account or an enterprise subscription with a cloud services provider of your choice, Blanket Ops requires this registration for administration and to ensure a smooth process in managing your resources in the platform.

### Deployments üè£
- Deploy multiple environments for multiple teams/users using different types of deployment strategies and schedules to fit your current purpose. Leverage our rollback built in capabilities within your deployment strategies to a achieve a full deployment lifecycle.

### Environments :	üëù 
- Blanket Ops is image and container based, your workloads/applications will be containers making up an environment that you define, following a LAMP stack structure (initial release). Backend, Database, Web Server and Frontend layers/components are provided as per initial release, these are container specifications per layer/component of your application stored in the cloud container service of your choice. These are serverless by default.

### Continous Development/Deployment and Integration: üè¢
- Build, Test,Deploy scan and artifact your application layer from a single image, choose the approach to your workflows and pipelines, build and store the CD/CI image in the repository of your choice. Your Image is secured as DevSecOps principles are followed to protect your hub of application deployment, development and integration.

### Operations: üë∑
- Manage your operational tickets from a single source of truth(application layer)

### Monitoring Metrics: üíª
- Aggregated centralized collected metrics from all your/defined reosources to tailor your dashboard and alarming(alerts) building and monitoring experience.

### Notifications: ‚åõ
- Aggregated centralized collected notifications  from all your/defined resources to tailor your approach to site realibity enginering processes you would wish to follow and enhance from.

### Security: üîß
- A common based yet effective approach to security and auditing by implementating a lifecycle based approach within different security toolset to scan vulnerabilities, run security audit reports and keep your organization safe.

### Processes üîà
- Schedule database backup,purge and any other batch related jobs  to your existing environments by passing a command or a script and a schedule to a specific container.

### Releases üè¢
- Manage application releases as they are created by DevOps Engineers or assigned, Blanket Ops will only recognise releases and or hotfixes created via git flow, from any of your registered applications. 

### Teams üöÄ
- Add your development teams, this allows fined grained access management to resources inside your platform, manage these teams and the resources they use

### Workstations üë∑
- Onboarding a set of developers by mirroring from an existing running environment to their local machine, ensures a consistent environment across multiple teams in charge of multiple parts of the same application, allows specific tailoring as is configuration. Developers and or Engineers can quickly focus on the tasks at hand.

## Goals üèÜ
- Allow organizations to migrate their DevOps tools to a Kubernetes Native based resource from a cloud provider of their choice.

- Be a self service Platform for developers/testers and operations engineers to collaborate, scale their infrastructure and follow best practices in DevOps working model.

- Be the bespoke layer of automation where users do not need to know information about the underlying infrastructure.

- Manage  workloads following a DevOps/SecOps/FinOps/TestOps Model in the cloud provider of your choice.

## Benefits üíª

### Developer Paradise üîî
- Seamless Developer workstation integrated with your existing application and containers in your registries of your cloud provider choice, allowing development teams to setup in minutes and focus on development.

### Operations Dilemma Over ‚åõ
- Operations Engineers, Business Analysts can easily prioritize incidents from multiple sources to track and escalate customer issues by leveraging 

### No Engineering Chaos üîß
- Based on a single source of truth following a GitOps model, the operator will keep track of the changes in and out of repositories to subsequently take action on resources of your choice.

### Customer Satisfaction üöÄ
Operations Engineers, Business Analysts can easily prioritize incidents from multiple sources to track and escalate customer issues by levereging BlanketOps Operations template.
